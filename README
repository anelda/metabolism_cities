The file "Dam levels 2012 to 2019.csv" was downloaded from the City of Cape Town Open Data Portal at
https://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/OpenDataPortal/DatasetDetail?DatasetName=Dam%20levels
on 1 June 2019.

This file has no README or metadata associated with it in the City of Cape Town Open Data Portal.

The raw CSV was converted to a 'tidy data' format using Python 3.6 in Jupyter Notebook where the steps 
are described in details along with the commands.

The Python script outputs a single file per dam containing the aggregated dam levels per month for 
the dates provided in the raw data. The new files are available from the folder metabolism_files.
