The file "Dam levels 2012 to 2019.csv" was downloaded from the City of Cape Town Open Data Portal at
https://web1.capetown.gov.za/web1/OpenDataPortal/DatasetDetail?DatasetName=Dam%20levels
on 1 June 2019.

This file has no README or metadata associated with it in the City of Cape Town Open Data Portal.

The raw CSV was converted to a 'tidy data' format using Python 3.6 in Jupyter Notebook where the steps 
are described in details along with the commands.

The Python script outputs two files:

- a file containing aggregated mean dam level as percentage for each month - all dams from January 2012 - May 2019
- a file containing aggregated mean dam level as volume (capacity) in millions of litres (ML) for each month - all dams from January 2012 - May 2019

The data was uploaded to [Metabolism of Cities](https://metabolismofcities.org) on 9 June 2019
